# NFT-Marketplace
## Learning project - an NFT marketplace

### Intentions

My main goal here is to simply learn and practice JS, React, NextJs/NodeJs and blockhain development in general. I want to have a funcional NFT marketplace based on the project from Angela Yu's Web development bootcamp's NFT Marketplace practice project [1].

I want to have different branches with different tech stacks, mainly focused on different blockhain platforms: Ethereum, Internet Protocol and Solana.

#### Milestones:

1. Ethereum/IC smart contracts written, tested and deployed to Rinkeby testnet/localhost IC
2. Simple Application implemented that uses these smart contracts
3. Frontend and Backend are separated (maybe with a REST API)
4. IC/Ethereum implementation, tests, deployment
5. (Hopefully only) Plug in new implementation through adapters
6. Solana implementation, tests, deployment (least experienced in)
7. (Hopefully only) Plug in new implementation through adapters
8. Pat on the back

Given the fact that I have other responsibilities, I want to finish this in 2 months.
